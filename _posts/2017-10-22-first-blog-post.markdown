### Finally!

I finally set up this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home). Tutorials on the internet are really not clear, and the only one I found useful
is Github Pages' tutorial, and reading through the docs of Jekyll.

Theme wise, I am using minima for now (Jekyll's default), but I'll have to improve it (either from scrath by writing `CSS`/`SASS` or using a theme).

Anyway, excited to start this blog.

### Next steps.
I need to:
* add a photos page, with a protfolio-like layout.
* update the about page.
* update the home page to make it different from the blog page.
* work a more appealing general look for the website.
