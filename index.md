I am a second year PhD student at [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Aapo Hyvärinen](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~aapoh/). Before the PhD, I completed an engineering degree at [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu) with a focus on computer science and applied mathematics. I also obtained a masters degree in Computer vision and Machine learning ([MVA](https://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/)).

Outside of the lab, I enjoy taking photos (mainly abstract and architectural), cooking and science fiction books.

## Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on unsupervised learning, namely non-linear Independent Component Analysis, disentangled representations and density estimation. I also have an interest in Neuroscience (particularly applying machine learning models on neuroimaging data), statistical physics and differential geometry.

I am always open for a research discussion.
